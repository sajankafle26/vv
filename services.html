                <p class="pb-5">I am Ben Carling, the owner and head coach at Sports Performance Services Ltd, based in
                    Douglas, Isle of Man. After studying business management, I decided embark in a career that was also
                    a passion of mine; health and fitness. I had played sports from an early age so it seemed a natural
                    thing to do. I became a qualified Personal Trainer, and latterly an accredited Strength and
                    Conditioning coach with the UKSCA. Currently there are only 4 accredited coaches in the Isle of Man,
                    and circa 600 in the UK.
                </p>
                <p>As well as private work, I work at the Isle of Man Sport Institute. I work with a wide cross section
                    of athletes from different sports, from field based sports such as football, rugby and hockey to
                    individual sports such as archery, sailing, tennis, motorsport and swimming. I am proud to have
                    played my part in helping these athletes set personal bests, Island records and some that have gone
                    on to achieve scholarships or youth contracts at professional level.
                </p>
